### Algorithm for Binary Search (Simple Steps)

1. **Input the number of elements (`n`)**: Ask the user how many elements they want in the array.
2. **Create and populate the array (`a`)**: 
   - Take `n` elements as input.
   - Ensure the array is sorted (binary search requires a sorted array).
3. **Input the search item (`items`)**: Ask the user for the number they want to search.
4. **Initialize variables**:
   - `beg`: Start of the array (`0`).
   - `end`: End of the array (`n - 1`).
   - `mid`: Middle index of the current range.
5. **Perform the binary search**:
   - While `beg` is less than or equal to `end`:
     - Calculate `mid` as the average of `beg` and `end`.
     - Compare the element at `a[mid]` with `items`:
       - If equal, mark it as found and stop the loop.
       - If `items` is greater, adjust `beg` to `mid + 1`.
       - If `items` is smaller, adjust `end` to `mid - 1`.
6. **Display the result**:
   - If the item is found, print its position.
   - Otherwise, indicate that the item is not found.

### Example README File

#### **Binary Search Program in Java**

This program implements the binary search algorithm, which efficiently searches for a target value in a sorted array by dividing the search range in half repeatedly.

---

#### **How It Works**

1. Prompts the user to input:
   - The size of the array.
   - The elements of the array (sorted beforehand by the user).
   - The item to search for in the array.
2. Uses binary search to locate the item by repeatedly halving the search range.
3. Displays the position of the item if found or notifies the user if the item doesn't exist in the array.

---

#### **Prerequisites**
- A sorted array (input provided by the user must be sorted).
- A basic understanding of Java and terminal/IDE usage.

---

#### **How to Run**

1. Copy the code into a file named `BinarySearch.java`.
2. Compile the file using:
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearch.java
   ```
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   java BinarySearch
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter the number of elements in the array.
   - Input the sorted elements of the array.
   - Specify the item to search.

#### **Sample Input/Output**

**Input:**
```
How many elements do you need: 
5
Enter the elements:
1 3 5 7 9
Enter the elements do you want to find:
7
```

**Output:**
```
Items found at 3 Position
```

**Input:**
```
How many elements do you need: 
4
Enter the elements:
2 4 6 8
Enter the elements do you want to find:
5
```

**Output:**
```
Item not found
```

---

#### **Key Concepts**
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), as the search range halves with each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no extra storage is required.

---

#### **Important Note**
The input array must be **sorted** for the binary search to work correctly. If the user provides an unsorted array, the results may be inaccurate. A sorting step can be added if required.
